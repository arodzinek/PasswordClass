The Run Down
============

This is all made for fun.  This is inspired by the very first chapter of the book
"Violent Python"[1].  Go read that book, it's a lot of fun! All proceeds from 
sales of Violent Python will go directly towards the Wounded Warrior Project[2].

The goals of this project are as follows:
    
    * Learn about opening and manipulating files
    * Learn just how fast a laptop can be
    * See for yourself why plaintext passwords are for babies!


Warning
=======

What we're learning today can be harmless, however you should be aware of local 
laws before you go and do something rash.

Also:  Be sure to follow this in order, atleast the first time.  Some files 
will purposely overwrite one another.  It's ok.
